# Markdown Compiler

This is a simple php project to create beautiful webpages from markdown (.md) files. In this way you are able to write md code and get an html webpage.

## Instalation üåê

To install the tool, you only need to clone the repository with:

```console
git clone https://github.com/GermnGodoy/php-markdown
```

And you will get a directory with an `index.php` file that contains the tool, and a `src` directory where you can put the `.md` files that you want to compile.

## Usage üé†

In order to use the tool, you just need to go to the root of the directory, and execute:

```console
php -S localhost:<port>
```

Substituting `<port>` with the port you want the webpages to be in.
